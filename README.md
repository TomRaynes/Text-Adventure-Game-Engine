# Text Adventure Game Engine

This repository contains an implementation of a text adventure game engine. Custom story lines are created by configuring a specific 'actions' file and 'entities' file.

### Note: A requirement of this assigment was to implement all functionality without using the following contructs:
- Lambdas
- Arrays and ArrayLists
- Ternary operators (i.e. the `?` if/else operator)
- Unqualified method calls (e.g. `executeOperation()` rather than `this.executeOperation()`)
- String concatenation (i.e. `System.out.println(string1 + string2)`)
